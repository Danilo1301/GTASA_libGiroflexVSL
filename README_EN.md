<h1>Config</h1>

Each vehicle has a .ini file where it stores its config<br>
Those files are located at: GAME_FOLDER/configs/giroflex

<h1>Issues</h1>

<h3>Crash with the libBASSMod.so</h3>

Some users have reported crashes with the new libBASSMod (which is for playing audio). If your game is crashing, try removing 'libBASSMod.so' from /mods folder

<h3>Message 'Remove the old giroflex.csa and .fxt'</h3>

If you see this message it means that there is a file called 'giroflex.csa' is one of the following folders:

* in the CLEO folder, in: /storage/emulated/0/cleo/sa/giroflex.csa
* or in the game folder, in: data/com.rockstargames.gtasa/giroflex.csa

You only need to delete this file (giroflex.csa) and the giroflex.fxt

<h3>Mods cleo not showing on menu</h3>

You just need to go in the game, then "Options" > "Game" and change the "CLEO LOCATION"<br>

* OLD CLEO - com.rockstargames.gtasa/ mod.csi
* OLD CLEO (+CLEO) - com.rockstargames.gtasa/cleo/ mod.csi
* ../FILES/CLEO - com.rockstargames.gtasa/files/cleo/ mod.csi
* CLEO 2.0.1 - storage/emulated/0/cleo/sa/ mod.csi

(Don't forget to restart the game to apply the changes)

<h3>Menu too much to the left</h3>

To change the menu's position, you need to enable the edit mode in: "Options" > "Mods Settings" > "Giroflex VSL - Edit mode"

<h3>Bent lights / Lights rotated to the side by a little</h3>

This happens when you use libJPatch.so with 'PS2CoronaRotation' enabled. To disable you have to go to your configs, in the .ini file, go the where this option is located and change it to 0 (PS2CoronaRotation=0)
